NAME
    Catalyst::Engine::Server - Catalyst Server Engine *DEPRECATED*

SYNOPSIS
    A script using the Catalyst::Engine::Server module might look like:

        #!/usr/bin/perl -w

        BEGIN {  $ENV{CATALYST_ENGINE} = 'Server' }

        use strict;
        use lib '/path/to/MyApp/lib';
        use MyApp;

        MyApp->run;

DESCRIPTION
  DEPRECATED

    This module is no longer recommended, and does not work correctly with
    latest versions of Catalyst. Please use Catalyst::Engine::HTTP, which is
    included in the main Catalyst distribution.

TODO
    Make HTTP/1.1 optional.
